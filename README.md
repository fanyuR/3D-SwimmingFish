# 3D SwimmingFish
An articulated and interactive object in the shape of a swimming fish developed by C and OpenGL.

## Introduction
- Develop a 3D hierarchical fish model and implement some rendering  
- Set light sources including a distant light source and a spotlight  
- Create a light source selection menu attached to the right button of mouse  
- Declare different types of materials for different parts of the object  
- Implement a material selection menu attached to the left button of mouse  
- Add animation to the fish which is swimming from one side of the window to the other
